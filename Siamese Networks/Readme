Required tasks and experiments
• Load the MNIST dataset (use keras.datasets.mnist.load_data).
• Split the dataset such that
◦ the digits in [2,3,4,5,6,7] are used for training and testing
◦ the digits in [0,1,8,9] are only used for testing. None of these digits should be used
during training.
• Implement and test the contrastive loss function described earlier in this document.
• Build a Siamese network.
• Train your Siamese network on your training set. Plot the training and validation error vs
time.
• Evaluate the generalization capability of your network by
◦ testing it with pairs from [2,3,4,5,6,7] x [2,3,4,5,6,7]
◦ testing it with pairs from [2,3,4,5,6,7] x [0,1,8,9]
◦ testing it with pairs from [0,1,8,9] x [0,1,8,9]
• Present your results in tables and figures.
